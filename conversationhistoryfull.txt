This lengthened the most recent interview to ~1hr 15m. Serena and I will go over Friday\u2019s interview this week to make sure we are comfortable with the script and with the increase in duration. *This week:* Praying today for Zoom\u2019s site reliability engineers as more universities and companies go remote. Filing an IRB modification to allow us to use remote transcription.
